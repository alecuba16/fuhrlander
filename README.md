# The dataset
This is a Fuhrl√§nder FL2500 2.5MW wind turbine dataset.

## Format
The dataset is stored in JSON format inside the "dataset" folder. It contains five wind turbines (80,81,82,83,84), each one with three years of data with a time interval from 2012 to 2014. The data frequency is 5 minutes reporting four indicators of each 78 sensors (a total of 312 variables). The reported values for each sensor are minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation for each 5-minute interval. The dataset also contains the alarms events, indicating the system and subsystem and a small description.

## Functions
We included several functions for {R,MATLAB,...} languages to providing an interface that pre-processes and manipulates the RAW data into a table-like format.
The table-like format is composed of the variables at the columns and each five-minute data entry in rows.
